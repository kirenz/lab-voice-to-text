Take a look at the [slides tutorial](https://kirenz.github.io/lab-toolkit/slides/slides.html#/title-slide) to learn how to use all slide options.

You have several options to start code development:

1. **Colab**: Click on one of the links "üíª Jupyter Notebook" to start a Colab session. 

2. **Local**: Click on one of the links "üíª Jupyter Notebook" below, go to the Colab menu and choose "File" > "Download" > "Download .ipynb"

3. **Cloud Codespace**: Work in a fully configured dev environment in the cloud with a [GitHub Codespace VS Code Browser](/https://github.com/kirenz/lab-XYZ/blob/main/README.md) environment.

4. **Local VS Code with Codespace**: Use [GitHub Codespaces in your local Visual Studio Code environment](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-github-codespaces-in-visual-studio-code).


For cost reasons we mainly use OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model in our tutorials. However, you can simply replace `model="gpt-3.5-turbo"` with `model="gpt-4"` in the helper function. Note the [price difference](https://openai.com/pricing) between the two models.
