# Introduction

Transcribe audio into whatever language the audio is in.

# Setup

```{python}
import openai
from pathlib import Path
import difflib

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

```

# Simple example

## Create mp3 data {.smaller}

- Use [ttsmp3](https://ttsmp3.com/) to generate your audio data
- save it as `example.mp3` in your Downloads folder

- Example text to use in [ttsmp3](https://ttsmp3.com/) :

```{markdown}
Welcome to the world of automatic speech recognition with OpenAI's Whisper API. Whisper is an automatic speech recognition system trained on a massive amount of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. It is designed to convert spoken language into written text, making transcription tasks a breeze.

```


## SSML {.smaller}

- You may use [Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supportedtags.html) to customize the output

```{markdown}
- Add a **break**: Mary had a little lamb <break time="1s"/> Whose fleece was white as snow.
- **Emphasizing**: I already told you I <emphasis level="strong">really like </emphasis> that person.
- **Speed**: For dramatic purposes, you might wish to <prosody rate="slow">slow down the speaking rate of your text.</prosody>
Or if you are in a hurry <prosody rate="fast">your may want to speed it up a bit.</prosody>
- **Pitch**: Do you like sythesized speech <prosody pitch="high">with a pitch that is higher than normal?</prosody> Or do you prefer your speech <prosody pitch="-20%">with a somewhat lower pitch?</prosody>
- **Whisper** <amazon:effect name="whispered">If you make any noise, </amazon:effect> she said, <amazon:effect name="whispered">they will hear us.</amazon:effect>
- **Conversations**: It is possible to switch between speakers within the text:
  - [speaker:Brian] Hello Emma
  - [speaker:Emma] Hey Brian
```

## Load data

```{python}
path_to_example = Path.home() / 'Downloads/example.mp3' 
```

. . .

```{python}
audio_file= open(path_to_example, "rb")
```

- 'r': Read mode. File is opened for reading. 
- 'b': Binary mode. File is opened in binary mode, which is used for non-text files (e.g., image and sound files).

## Transcribe

File uploads are currently limited to 25 MB and the following input file types are supported: mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, and webm.

```{python}
transcript = openai.Audio.transcribe("whisper-1", audio_file)
transcript
```

. . .

```{bash}
<OpenAIObject at 0x117dea450> JSON: {
  "text": "Welcome to the world of Automatic Speech Recognition  \
  with OpenAI's Whisper API. Whisper is an automatic speech  \
  recognition system trained on a massive amount of multilingual \
  and multitask supervised data collected from the web. It is designed \
  to convert spoken language into written text, making transcription tasks a breeze."
}

```


# Extract only text

```{python}
text_output = transcript['text']
text_output
```

- Output:

. . .

```{markdown}
"Welcome to the world of Automatic Speech Recognition with OpenAI's Whisper API. Whisper is an automatic speech recognition system trained on a massive amount of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. It is designed to convert spoken language into written text, making transcription tasks a breeze."

```

# Save text

```{python}
write_to_output = Path.home() / 'Downloads/output.txt' 
```

. . .

```{python}
with open(write_to_output, 'w') as file:
    file.write(text_output)
```


# Workflow for multiple files

- We will use an example with multiple .mp3 files which are stored in the 'Downloads' folder

- Note that the files will be renamed during the process

## Prepare environment

- Create a new folder called `data` in your Downloads folder
- Place at least two mp3 files in your `data` folder

## Obtain file names

```{python}

downloads_folder = Path.home() / 'Downloads/data'

mp3_files = [f for f in downloads_folder.iterdir() if f.suffix == '.mp3']

```

## Obtain time of storage 

```{python}
# Get file paths along with their stored time
file_details = [(f, f.stat().st_mtime) for f in mp3_files]
```

## Sort files according to time


```{python}
sorted_files = sorted(file_details, key=lambda x: x[1])
```

## Move and rename files

- Move the files to a folder of your choice (we use our data folder) and rename the files to 01_audio, 02_audio, etc.

. . .

```{python}

destination_folder = Path.home() / 'Downloads/data'

for idx, (file_path, _) in enumerate(sorted_files):
    dest_path = destination_folder / f"{str(idx+1).zfill(2)}_audio.mp3"
    file_path.rename(dest_path)


```


## Transcripe helper function


```{python}
def transcribe_audio(audio_file_path):
    """
    Transcribe the given audio file using OpenAI's Whisper ASR system.
    """
    audio_file_path = Path(audio_file_path)  # Convert to Path object if it's not already
    with audio_file_path.open("rb") as audio_file:
        response = openai.Audio.transcribe("whisper-1", audio_file)
    return response["text"]

```


## Apply function

```{python}

data_folder = destination_folder

# Get a list of all audio files in the /data/ folder
audio_files = sorted(data_folder.glob('*.mp3'))

for audio_file in audio_files:
    # Transcribe the audio file
    transcription = transcribe_audio(audio_file)

    # Create a new txt file name based on the audio file's name
    txt_file_name = audio_file.stem + ".txt"
    txt_file_path = data_folder / txt_file_name

    # Save the transcription to the txt file
    with txt_file_path.open('w') as txt_file:
        txt_file.write(transcription)

```


## Save as markdown


```{python}

markdown_content = []

# Iterate through all txt files in the /data/ folder
txt_files = sorted(data_folder.glob('*.txt'))

for txt_file in txt_files:
    # Read the content of the txt file
    with txt_file.open('r') as file:
        file_content = file.read()
    
    # Append the file name as a headline and then the content to the markdown content list
    markdown_content.append(f"# {txt_file.name}\n\n{file_content}\n")

# Join all the markdown content pieces to create the final document
final_markdown = "\n".join(markdown_content)

# Save the combined content to a markdown file
output_file = data_folder / "combined_audio_transcriptions.md"
with output_file.open('w') as file:
    file.write(final_markdown)
```

# Post processing with GPT

## System prompt

```{python}
system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant. \
    Your task is to correct any spelling discrepancies in the \
    transcribed text. Only add necessary punctuation such as \
    periods, commas, and capitalization, and use only the context provided"
```

## Helper function

```{python}
def generate_corrected_transcript(temperature, system_prompt, transcribed_text):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        temperature=temperature,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": system_prompt
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": transcribed_text
            }
        ]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
```




## Correct data for multiple files {.smaller}

- In the appendix is an example of how to correct a single file

```{python}
# Directory containing the transcription files
data_folder = destination_folder

# List to hold the corrected transcriptions
corrected_transcriptions = []

# Iterate through each individual .txt file
for txt_file_path in sorted(data_folder.glob('??_audio.txt')):
    # Read the transcription from the file
    with txt_file_path.open('r') as txt_file:
        transcription = txt_file.read()

    # Post-process the transcription using GPT-4
    corrected_text = generate_corrected_transcript(0.5, system_prompt, transcription)
    
    # Append the file name as a headline and then the corrected content to the list
    corrected_transcriptions.append(f"# {txt_file_path.name}\n\n{corrected_text}\n")

# Combine the corrected transcriptions and save them to the new markdown file
output_file = data_folder / "corrected_text.md"
with output_file.open('w') as out_file:
    out_file.write("\n".join(corrected_transcriptions))

```


## Show differences {.smaller}

```{python}
# Define file paths
original_file_path = Path.home() / 'Downloads/data/combined_audio_transcriptions.md' 

corrected_file_path = Path.home() / 'Downloads/data/corrected_text.md'

# Read the content of both markdown files
with original_file_path.open('r') as f:
    original_content = f.readlines()

with corrected_file_path.open('r') as f:
    corrected_content = f.readlines()

# Generate a side-by-side comparison in HTML format
differ = difflib.HtmlDiff()
comparison_html = differ.make_file(original_content, corrected_content)

# Add custom CSS for content wrapping and better visualization
custom_css = """
<style>
    body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        margin: 20px;
    }
    table.diff {
        width: 100%;
        border-collapse: collapse;
    }
    td {
        vertical-align: top;
        padding: 5px;
        border: 1px solid #ddd;
        white-space: pre-wrap;
        word-break: break-word;
        overflow-wrap: break-word;
    }
</style>
"""

# The rest of your code remains the same...


# Insert the custom CSS into the generated HTML content
comparison_html = comparison_html.replace('<head>', '<head>' + custom_css)


# Save the HTML comparison to a file
output_html_path = Path.home() / 'Downloads/data/comparison.html'
with output_html_path.open('w') as f:
    f.write(comparison_html)

```
